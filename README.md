# quora-question-pair

This repo contains the final solution for our course project.

Please directly look at the `final_submission` folder, it contains submitted code.

Only [this file](https://github.com/Kulbear/quora-question-pair/blob/master/final_submission/nn.ipynb) contains code that are taken from others work.

The preprocessing code (with lots of modification though) is taken from the web (cannot find the original post anymore....)

The code of the first model is from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lystdo/lb-0-18-lstm-with-glove-and-magic-features)

In the feature pre-processing part, we borrowed the idea from [this post](https://www.kaggle.com/act444/lb-0-158-xgb-handcrafted-leaky).

But we didn't use the code from the post.

# Run

If you want to reproduce the result, you need to download the `train.csv` and `test.csv` from Kaggle, and you also need to download the pre-trained GloVe model.

Then you can just run `nn.ipynb`, and others .ipynb file.
